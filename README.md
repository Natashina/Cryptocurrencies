# Cryptocurrencies


### The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market. The data was retrieved from CryptoCompare.

### 1. Some data preprocessing tasks have been performed for next steps - dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering with K-means

### 2. Using PCA data dimensions of the X DataFrame were reduced down to three principal components - PC1, PC2, PC3.

### 3. Elbow Curve have been used to determine the Best K Value. At the top left point, the line goes as vertical slope that firstly breaks at point 4, turns to a slightly horizontal slope, that changes again at point 5, then continues to a strong horizontal line at point 10. Therefore, the best value for K was defined as 5.
